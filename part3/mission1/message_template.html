      Dr. Han, we received your message. We could not understand the situation at first; we froze,
      then cried as we hugged each other. We are so grateful that you are alive. We will do our best too.
      Just in case your condition is not good, we are sending this message in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the silence of Mars, being connected to Earth is itself a blessing. We will share your message
      with those who can help most effectively, and we will continue to reach out until you are safely home.
    </p>
    <p>
      With hope,<br>
      The Support Team
    </p>
